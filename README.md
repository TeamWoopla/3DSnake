# 3DSnake
After learning the basic fundamentals of PyOpenGL we decided to test our knowledge by making yet another snake game, but this time you can move on 3 axis. Imagine a big box, and in this box, smaller equal boxes that fill up the big box to it's max capacity, This is the grid. This game is extremely hard and can make you to break your own computer from anger. Playing it is at your own risk. This project was a really fun project to make and we're really looking forward for our next 3D project.
